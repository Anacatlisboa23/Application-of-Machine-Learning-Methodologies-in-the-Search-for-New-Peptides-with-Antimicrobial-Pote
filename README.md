Antibiotic resistance is considered a global risk, so it is crucial to explore alternatives to conventional antibiotics. Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional antibiotics. The experimental identification of promising new antibiotics and their susceptibility parameters
can be time-consuming and expensive. In contrast, the use of algorithmic approaches to antibiotic discovery
has the potential to significantly influence the development of innovative antibacterial compounds in a short space of time.
innovative antibacterial compounds in a short space of time. 
With this in mind, this project aims to create datasets, employ classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning architecture algorithms for binary classification tasks and train models to predict Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values.
